# Auto-Rotate
Auto-Rotate is a FoundryVTT module which allows tokens to automatically rotate based on triggers such as movement, targeting, etc.

Credit goes to [Eadorin](https://github.com/eadorin) for the original [about-face](https://github.com/eadorin/about-face) module. Auto-Rotate has most of the features of about-face, but uses a completely re-worked implementation.

Credit also goes to [TyphonJS's](https://github.com/typhonjs-fvtt) [demo-rollup-module](https://github.com/typhonjs-fvtt/demo-rollup-module) module, which was used as a project template.

## How to Use ##
  - Open an actor's token configuration by first opening their sheet, then clicking the `Prototype Token` or `Token` labels on the sheet's window bar.
  - In the token configuration window, click the 'Position".
  - Enable or disable the checkbox next to "Enable Autorotate". Note that the "Rotation Lock" toggle must be off!

## Current Functionality ##
  - Per-token rotation settings.
  - Rotation on token movement.
  - Rotation on token targeting.

## Future Functionality ##
  - Per-direction token sprites.
  - Visual indicators on hover, selection, etc.
